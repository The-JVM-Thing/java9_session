**Trisha Gee: Real world Java 9**  
_"The feature we always hear about whenever Java 9 is in the news is Jigsaw, modularity for Java. But modularity just doesn't scratch the same developer itch that Java 8's lambdas and streams did, and as developers we're left with a vague sensation that version 9 might just not be that interesting._

_In fact, Java 9 actually has a lot of great additions and changes which will make Java just that bit nicer to work with."_
